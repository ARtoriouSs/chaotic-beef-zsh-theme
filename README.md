# Chaotic beef

It's a tiny and beautiful theme for Oh-My-Zsh without something superfluous, it'll only show * if the git index
is not empty and â‰  if current branch needs to be rebased on a default branch. The default branch is master by default,
but you can override it for particular repos by creating `.git/safe/default_branch` file with the branch name in it:

```bash
mkdir .git/safe/
touch .git/safe/default_branch
echo develop > .git/safe/default_branch
```

You can find more info about `.git/safe` [here](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-safe).
